Kasa is a leading platform for peer-to-peer apartment rentals in France, with over 500 new listings posted daily.

## Project Overview

I am thrilled to be part of Kasa's ambitious project to completely overhaul their website. Originally coded in ASP.NET over 10 years ago, the site is undergoing a transformation to a full JavaScript stack with NodeJS on the backend and React on the frontend. This redesign includes new responsive designs commissioned from our freelance designer.

## My Role

My task is to kickstart the React project and develop the entire application, including React components and React Router for navigation. I will closely follow the Figma mockups provided, ensuring high-quality code throughout.

## Data Handling

Due to delays in backend recruitment, I will work with a JSON file containing the latest 20 housing listings extracted for development purposes.

## Technical Constraints

I will adhere to Kasa's coding guidelines provided here.
While Create React App is the preferred tool, I have the flexibility to use alternatives like Vite for bundling if needed.
